## SOLID principles

Make the programs more maintainable, flexible and understandable.

**S**ingle responsibility principle:
every module, class or function should be responsible for one thing only.

**O**pen-closed principle:
software should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Extend a class without modifying the source code.

**L**iskov substitution principle:
if S is a subtype of T then objects of type T may be replaced by objects
of type S without breaking the program.

**I**nterface segregation principle:
no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

**D**ependency inversion principle:
A high level module should not import anything from a low level module.
Abstraction should not depend on details.
